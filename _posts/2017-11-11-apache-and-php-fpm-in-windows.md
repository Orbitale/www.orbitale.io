We see _a lot_ of research over the internet to make Apache & PHP-FPM work on windows.

But the first thing is: **there is no `php-fpm` on Windows**. And many people give up on this, because of too many or
too complex solutions we find over the internet.

For sanity reasons, I will never talk about FPM on Windows, but I will instead talk about FastCGI.<br>
Because FPM stands for FastCGI Process Manager. It's just a _manager_ for FastCGI processes.

So, let's make a first reminder about how we use to deal with Apache & PHP on Windows, and then we'll update our setup
to FastCGI.

## Installing Apache and PHP on Windows

For some people, the Apache service is provided by WampServer, EasyPHP or other *AMP-like setup.

I personally hate these pre-built services because upgrading them is a [PITA](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PITA), and
most of the time the setup is not always performant, everything depend on the rest, etc.

In my case, I'm using [Apache Lounge](https://www.apachelounge.com) which is a stand-alone Apache server for Windows.

Then, I download [PHP for Windows](http://windows.php.net/download/) on [windows.php.net](http://windows.php.net), which
can be installed wherever I want.

⚡⚠ Warning: For `mod_php`, you need the **thread safe (`ts`)** version of PHP.<br>
When we'll install our FastCGI setup, you will have to download PHP again with the **non-thread-safe (`nts`)** version.<br>
I personally have both versions installed in `php-ts` and `php-nts` directories in my computer, in case of.

I also download a windows version of MariaDB and PostgreSQL for my apps, but it's not the subject.

All of this **decoupled setup** is **very flexible**, and it's what we need.

Then, let's configure it.

Before talking about FastCGI, let's see what we use to do, most of the time.

## Configuring Apache and PHP with `mod_php`: what everyone says

This is really easy to do, because it's a few lines in our `{ApacheLounge}/conf/httpd.conf`: 

```apacheconfig
# Load PHP module from our setup.
LoadModule php7_module e:\dev\php71\php7apache2_4.dll

# Custom php.ini file, because it's important to have a different file than the command-line.
PHPIniDir "e:/dev/php71/php-apache.ini"

# And the default config to make Apache run PHP for PHP files.
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

# Deny access to raw php sources by default
<FilesMatch ".+\.phps$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

# Deny access to files without filename (e.g. '.php')
<FilesMatch "^\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml|ps)$">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
```

And that's all. Just configure a vhost to point on your project and you're set:

```apacheconfig
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName 127.0.0.1
    DocumentRoot e:/dev/www
    <Directory e:/dev/www>
        AllowOverride all
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

But here, we're using `mod_php`.

## Why FastCGI?

It's well-known that `mod_php` can have some RAM or CPU issues, that projects with lots of calls at the same time can
suffer from timeouts, memory and cache not managed like we would like to, etc.

Also, using this extension prevents you to have multiple PHP versions installed. Because with `mod_php` you can have 
only one php extension loaded, and only one file handler for the same patterns.

With FastCGI in general, you can configure communication between Apache and PHP in different ways, and
especially between virtual hosts. So if you have your PHP 7.1 app and PHP 5.4 legacy bag of crap you want to maintain on
your same Windows computer, you're almost forced to use FastCGI.

The only solution to have multiple PHP versions with Apache and mod_php is  to comment/uncomment lines of code in your
`httpd.conf` everytime you switch projects.

And what if projects communicate together with API calls? Well, you're f***ed, then...

So, let's move on to FastCGI.

## Configure Apache with FastCGI

First thing to do is to configure apache. We'll configure PHP later.

Lucky we are: it's even easier than with `mod_php`.

**You can remove all the `mod_php` config we added before**. We'll replace it with another config. And it was just a
reminder, because it's cool to know what whe're doing.

Open your `httpd.conf` file, and after removing all `mod_php` garbage, activate these two extensions:

```apacheconfig
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so
```

The `proxy` module is here to help us using Apache like a proxy.

Nothing fancy here. If we want to explain it simply, let's say that Apache will sort of be able to _delegate_ some HTTP
requests to another service via a _protocol_ (and this service will sometimes be called a _gateway_).

The `proxy_fcgi` module is just here to add the `fcgi` protocol to the Proxy, so we can communicate with a gateway by
using this protocol. But we could have been using other protocols for other needs, like `ftp`, `http` or even `ws`
(web-sockets).

When FastCGI proxy is enabled, let's tell Apache we want to use our PHP config:

```apacheconfig
<Files ~ "\.php$">
    SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000#"
</Files>
```

Ok, the PHP config is not ready yet, but what these likes say is that any file matching `\.(php|phtml)$` will tell 
Apache to _handle_ the request via a `proxy`, that will use the `fcgi` protocol to send the HTTP request to `127.0.0.1`.

The port `9000` is the one we'll use in our PHP config, and it's the default one used in `php-fpm` in unix systems.

And the `#` seems to come from an issue inside Apache modules that do not send the correct path to the gateway, and this
issue is fixed by adding this character at the end of the handler's url. 

That's all. We can leave our Apache config and move to PHP one.

## Configure PHP CGI module

CGI is very old (1993) and cool. It's an interface for HTTP servers to be able to execute another program instead of
just displaying the resource asked by the user.

In short words, it's meant to _execute_ our PHP files instead of just _showing the PHP file's content_.

It's a protocol which is really nice when dealing with stuff like interpreted languages like PHP, Ruby, etc., because it
allow us to just use our web-server without knowing what it does so we don't learn anything about HTTP web servers and
how our interpreters work. It's a nice jump into _"Damn it doesn't work!"_ instead of _"I probably did something wrong,
let's fix this."_.

Just a small reminder: I said in the [Installing Apache and PHP on Windows](#installing-apache-and-php-on-windows) part
that here you **must** have the `nts` version of PHP. Make sure you have the right one starting from her.

Well, we have many options, but I'll talk about options later.

We need PHP to be run **as a service**. Dammit, what's a service in Windows ?

It's a specific type of process that runs sort of "in the background" in order to process tasks, pop alerts, monitor,
or just make your computer works.

Somehow they can be similarly compared to what you have in your `/etc/init.d` in unix systems. But it's not the same.
Because you know, difference between UNIX and NT stuff, etc.

Why run it as service? Because else, you would have to double-click on the CGI script, and make sure the `cmd` window is
not closed, and restarting it will be boring, etc.
Having a service is nice because we can just restart it in the "Services" panel if we need, and it can be automatically
launched on Windows startup. 

### Create the CGI service

To create a service, we could run into the `sc` command in Windows, but I find it very neat that we can setup a service
without torturing ourselves.

So I'm using [NSSM](https://nssm.cc) to manage my personal services.

It's great because I've set up PHP-CGI, Apache, MariaDB and Blackfire Agent with it, and it's lovely.

So, download this small executable, run `nssm install`, and a cool popup will show.

You'll fill a few options:

![NSSM options](/img/nssm_app.jpg) 

Just an explanation about the options:

* `php-cgi.exe` is the script we must execute. `php.exe` is a command-line interface (CLI), not a CGI one.
* `-c E:\dev\php71\php-apache.ini` is used to specify our `php.ini` file. I named it like this, but you can change it if
you like.
* `-b 127.0.0.1:9000` is the IP and port that PHP CGI will listen to. We need it to be as closed as possible, so we only
allow requests corresponding to `127.0.0.1`. And as said when configuring Apache, `9000` is the default port for the
`php-fpm` unix config, so let's use it because it's a common thing.

That's all!

Now your project should work.

## More flexibility: multiple PHP versions with Apache

This is often asked, so let's see how we can handle this.

First, if you have multiple PHP versions, you **must** create multiple `php-cgi` services, so this is why `nssm` is
really nice: it's as easy as two lines of config. Just create a new service pointing to your other PHP version, and
change the port to `9001`, `9002` or whatever you like that does not conflict with any other software.

Then, you will have to **remove the `SetHandler` config from `httpd.conf`** and move it to your vhosts, like this:

```apacheconfig
<VirtualHost *:80>
    # Our PHP 7.1 application, using the first cgi module listening to port 9000
    ServerName php71-app.dev
    DocumentRoot e:/dev/www/app1
    <Files ~ "\.(php|phtml)$">
        SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000#"
    </Files>
    <Directory e:/dev/www/app1>
        AllowOverride all
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    # Our PHP 5.4 application, using the second cgi module listening to port 9001
    ServerName php54-app.dev
    DocumentRoot e:/dev/www/app2
    <Files ~ "\.(php|phtml)$">
        SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:9001#"
    </Files>
    <Directory e:/dev/www/app2>
        AllowOverride all
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

That's it, now you can enjoy having multiple PHP versions!
