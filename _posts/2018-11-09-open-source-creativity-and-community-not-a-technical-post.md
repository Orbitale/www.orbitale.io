What I tend to do, most of the time, is to help people, help the world being better, as much as I can. As an optimistic man, I'd say that it's not pointless to hope that the world is going to be a better place one day. After all, dreamers have always existed, and John Lennon sang it a few decades ago.

What's the point of this post? It's in the complete middle of a technical blog, and potentially has no place in here.

Or does it?

I've been working in tech with my mental disorders as a burden for years, and it's still hard for me to keep going "well", so this is why I'm writing this today.

To sum up: I need to work less, and be more creative, and I want to continue to help people.

This needs time. And I've been told many times that open-source doesn't pay and nobody wants to pay for open-source.

Do you think open-source and free activities would pay?

That's a question I've been asking myself for years, and I discovered creators like [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA), [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw), [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA), and tons of others that I won't quote here because I'm not sure I would remember all of them (and I could also list the channels I follow on Youtube).

All these awesome creators are making what makes me vibe: they share knowledge and science. I also follow tons of creators that just create art (music, illustrations, etc.).

They all do what makes the world a better place. 

Banks, triple-A companies, GAFAM or most start-ups rule the world, but they don't really contribute to making everything better. It's just my opinion.

Therefore, I want to create things too. I'm starting a therapy to help myself find more time to create and contribute.

For this, I will create a Youtube channel soon and I will try to buy some tools to record myself.

Amongst the activities I will try to share, there will be:

* Code (of course, I'm a coder, and this is my main field of activity).
* Some thoughts about some random subjects (like things I read in books for example).
* I'll try to compose music (I ordered instruments and they'll come in a few weeks, so when I'll find time to teach myself how to record, I will share the work).
* I like drawing but I'm no expert at all, and I wish I could practice to get skills, so I will make some drawings timelapses or samples, and put them online, sometimes.

To promote this, I created a Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/pierstoval
